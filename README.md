# Basic Todo List Application

A simple command-line todo list application built in Python to manage your daily tasks efficiently.

## Description

This todo list application allows you to keep track of your tasks through a clean and straightforward command-line interface. Created as part of my Python learning journey, this project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including dictionaries, function definitions, error handling, and user input management.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Create and store new tasks with automatic ID assignment
- **Remove Tasks**: Delete tasks with automatic list re-indexing
- **View Tasks**: Display all current tasks in a numbered list
- **Simple Navigation**: Easy-to-use menu system
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid inputs

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd todo-list-python
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```
   python to_do_lists.py
   ```

## Usage

After launching the application, you'll see a menu with 4 options:

1. **Add task** - Enter a new task description
2. **Remove task** - Select a task by number to remove
3. **View tasks** - Display all current tasks
4. **Quit** - Exit the application

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files:
- `to_do_lists.py`: Contains all the application logic
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+ (utilizes match-case statements)
- Core Python libraries (no external dependencies)

## Future Enhancements

- Task persistence (save tasks between sessions)
- Task categories or priorities
- Due dates for tasks
- Task completion status
